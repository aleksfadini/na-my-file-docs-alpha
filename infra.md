Understanding the project structure helps in navigating the codebase and makes it easier to locate specific files and components when working on the "My File" application.

## Configuration

The "My File" application uses various configuration settings to customize its behavior and adapt to different deployment environments. Let's explore how to configure the application and understand the different configuration options available.

### Environment-Specific Configurations

- The application supports multiple deployment environments, such as development, staging, and production.
- Each environment can have its own set of configuration values.
- The environment-specific configurations are stored in separate files located in the `config/` directory.
- The naming convention for the configuration files is `config.<environment>.ts`, where `<environment>` represents the name of the environment (e.g., `config.development.ts`, `config.staging.ts`, `config.production.ts`).
- The configuration files export an object that contains key-value pairs representing the configuration settings for that environment.
- Example configuration file (`config.development.ts`):

  ```typescript
  export default {
    apiBaseUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
    databaseUrl: "postgresql://localhost:5432/my_file_app_dev",
    s3BucketName: "my-file-app-dev-bucket",
    // ...other configuration settings
  };
  ```

### Accessing Configuration Settings

- The application uses a configuration module to load the appropriate configuration settings based on the current environment.
- The configuration module is located at `src/config/index.ts`.
- It determines the current environment based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.
- The configuration module exports an object that merges the base configuration (`config.base.ts`) with the environment-specific configuration.
- Example usage of the configuration module:

  ```typescript
  import config from "./config";

  console.log(config.apiBaseUrl);
  // Output: 'http://localhost:3000' (in development environment)
  ```

### Environment Variables

- In addition to the configuration files, the application also uses environment variables to store sensitive or dynamic configuration values.
- Environment variables are loaded from the `.env` file located in the project root directory.
- The `.env` file should contain key-value pairs representing the environment variables.
- Example `.env` file:
  ```
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/my_file_app_dev
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
  ```
- To access environment variables in the code, you can use the `process.env` object.
- Example usage of environment variables:

  ```typescript
  const databaseUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
  const awsAccessKeyId = process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID;
  ```

### CDK Configuration

- The AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) used for infrastructure provisioning also requires configuration.
- The CDK configuration is stored in the `cdk.json` file located in the project root directory.
- The `cdk.json` file contains settings such as the AWS account and region, stack names, and other CDK-specific configurations.
- Example `cdk.json` file:

  ```json
  {
    "app": "npx ts-node --prefer-ts-exts infra/bin/cdk.ts",
    "context": {
      "@aws-cdk/core:newStyleStackSynthesis": true,
      "aws-cdk:enableDiffNoFail": true
    }
  }
  ```

### Customizing Configuration

- To customize the configuration for your specific deployment, you can modify the configuration files and environment variables according to your requirements.
- Update the values in the configuration files (`config.<environment>.ts`) to match your deployment settings.
- Set the appropriate environment variables in the `.env` file or configure them in your deployment pipeline.
- Ensure that sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys, are not committed to version control and are securely managed.

By leveraging the configuration files, environment variables, and CDK configuration, you can easily adapt the "My File" application to different environments and deployment scenarios. This flexibility allows you to customize the application's behavior and integrate it with your existing infrastructure and services.

Remember to review and update the configuration settings whenever you deploy the application to a new environment or make changes to the infrastructure.

- The SQS queue is used as an event source for the `wsBroadcastMessageHandler` Lambda function to process and broadcast messages to connected WebSocket clients.
- The queue configuration, including the queue URL and ARN, is exported as SSM parameters.

These infrastructure components work together to provide a robust and scalable foundation for the "My File" application. The AWS CDK code defines and provisions these resources, while the application code interacts with them through the exported SSM parameters and AWS SDKs.

By leveraging these managed services from AWS, the "My File" application achieves high availability, scalability, and security without the need for extensive infrastructure management overhead.

## Database Management

The "My File" application uses Prisma, a modern database toolkit, for managing and interacting with the database. Prisma provides an intuitive way to define the database schema, perform database migrations, and query the database using a type-safe API. Let's explore how the provided code handles database management.

### Database Schema Definition

- The database schema is defined in the `schema.prisma` file located in the `prisma/` directory.
- The schema file uses the Prisma schema language to define the data models, relations, and configurations for the database.
- Each model in the schema represents a table in the database, and the fields within the model represent the columns of the table.
- The schema also specifies the database provider (e.g., `sqlserver`) and the connection URL using the `datasource` block.
- Example model definition:

  ```prisma
  model tbl_Login {
    UserID     Int     @id(map: "PK_Table_1") @default(autoincrement())
    Username   String? @db.VarChar(50)
    Pwd        String? @db.VarChar(50)
    Email      String? @db.VarChar(50)
    // ...
  }
  ```

### Database Connection and Configuration

- The database connection and configuration are handled in the `src/lib/db.ts` file.
- The `getDB` function is responsible for creating and returning an instance of the Prisma client.
- The function retrieves the database connection string from the `DB_CREDS` environment variable and parses it to obtain the necessary connection details.
- The Prisma client is instantiated with the connection string and additional configuration options, such as logging settings.
- The `getDB` function ensures that only one instance of the Prisma client is created and reused throughout the application.

### Database Queries and Operations

- The application uses the Prisma client to perform database queries and operations.
- The Prisma client provides a type-safe and intuitive API for interacting with the database.
- Example usage of the Prisma client:
  ```typescript
  const db = getDB();
  const user = await db.tbl_Login.findUnique({
    where: { UserID: 1 },
  });
  ```
- The Prisma client supports various query operations, such as `findUnique`, `findMany`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, and more.
- The queries are written using the Prisma client's fluent API, which allows for easy composition and filtering of data.

### Database Migrations

- Database migrations are managed using Prisma's migration system.
- Migrations are defined in the `prisma/migrations/` directory and are automatically created when changes are made to the schema file.
- The migration files contain the necessary SQL statements to update the database schema and apply the changes.
- To run the migrations and sync the database with the schema, the `npx prisma migrate deploy` command can be used.
- The migration process ensures that the database schema stays in sync with the application's data models.

### Database Seeding and Data Population

- The code does not include explicit database seeding or data population scripts.
- However, Prisma supports data seeding through the use of seed scripts, which can be defined in the `prisma/seed.ts` file.
- Seed scripts allow for the initial population of the database with sample or default data.
- To run the seed script, the `npx prisma db seed` command can be used.

### Database Access and Security

- The database connection string, which includes the database credentials, is stored securely in the `DB_CREDS` environment variable.
- The connection string is parsed and used to instantiate the Prisma client, ensuring that the database credentials are not exposed in the codebase.
- Prisma provides an abstraction layer over the database, which helps prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks.
- It is important to properly configure database access controls, such as user permissions and roles, to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the data.

By leveraging Prisma for database management, the "My File" application benefits from a type-safe and efficient way to interact with the database. Prisma's schema-driven approach and migration system make it easier to evolve the database schema over time and maintain data integrity.

Remember to follow database security best practices, regularly backup your data, and monitor database performance to ensure a smooth and reliable user experience.

## Security Considerations

Security is a critical aspect of any application, and the "My File" application takes several measures to ensure the protection of sensitive data and resources. Let's explore the security considerations in relation to the provided code.

### Explanation of IAM Roles, Policies, and Permissions

- The code uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage access to AWS resources.
- IAM roles are created to grant specific permissions to AWS services and resources used by the application.
- For example, the `websocketApi` in the `WebsocketApiStack` is associated with an IAM role that grants permissions to access and manage WebSocket connections.
- The `wsMessageHandler` and `wsBroadcastMessageHandler` Lambda functions are assigned IAM policies that allow them to perform specific actions, such as invoking the `execute-api:ManageConnections` action on the WebSocket API.
- The IAM policies are defined using the `PolicyStatement` construct from the `aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam` module.
- Example IAM policy statement:
  ```typescript
  this.wsMessageHandler.addToRolePolicy(
    new PolicyStatement({
      actions: ["execute-api:ManageConnections"],
      resources: [connectionsArns],
    })

- It is important to follow the principle of least privilege and grant only the necessary permissions to each IAM role and resource.

### Best Practices for Securing Sensitive Information

- The code demonstrates several best practices for securing sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys.
- Sensitive information is stored using AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, which provides a secure way to store and retrieve configuration data.
- For example, the database credentials are stored in the `DB_CREDS` environment variable, which is retrieved from the Parameter Store.
- The `getDB` function in `src/lib/db.ts` retrieves the database credentials from the environment variable and uses them to establish a connection to the database.
- API keys and other sensitive configuration values are also stored as SSM parameters and accessed using the `ssm.StringParameter` construct in the CDK stacks.
- Example SSM parameter definition:
  ```typescript
  new ssm.StringParameter(this, `param-sqs-broadcast-message-queueurl`, {
    stringValue: this.sqsBroadcastMessageQueue.queueUrl,
    parameterName: `/${appMetadata.AppName}/${deploymentTarget}/sqs-broadcast-message-queueurl`,
  });
  ```
- It is crucial to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the codebase and instead rely on secure storage mechanisms like AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager.

### Recommendations for Implementing Additional Security Measures

- Encryption:
  - Enable encryption at rest for sensitive data stored in Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon RDS databases, and Amazon ElastiCache Redis clusters.
  - Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys and ensure secure encryption and decryption of data.
  - Implement client-side encryption for sensitive user data before storing it in the database or transmitting it over the network.
- Network Isolation:
  - Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to create a private network environment for your application resources.
  - Configure security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to only the necessary ports and protocols.
  - Use VPC endpoints to enable private connectivity between AWS services without exposing them to the public internet.
- Authentication and Authorization:
  - Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), for user access to the application.
  - Use Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization, as demonstrated in the `CognitoAuthStack`.
  - Enforce least privilege access control by defining granular permissions for different user roles and groups.
- Logging and Monitoring:
  - Enable logging for all critical application components, including Lambda functions, API Gateway, and database queries.
  - Use AWS CloudWatch to collect and analyze log data for security events and anomalies.
  - Set up alerts and notifications for suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.
- Regular Security Updates and Patches:
  - Keep all application dependencies, libraries, and frameworks up to date with the latest security patches.
  - Regularly monitor for security vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by the application and promptly apply necessary updates.
  - Perform periodic security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address potential security weaknesses.

By implementing these security measures and following best practices, the "My File" application can enhance its overall security posture and protect sensitive user data and system resources.

Remember to regularly review and update the security configurations, monitor for security events, and educate users about security best practices to maintain a secure application environment.
