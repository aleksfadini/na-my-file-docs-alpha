# My File API Client

This repository contains a TypeScript/JavaScript client that utilizes the Axios library to interact with the My File API. The client is auto-generated using the Swagger CodeGen tool based on the API specification.

### Purpose

The purpose of this client is to provide a convenient way to interact with the My File API from Node.js, Webpack, or Browserify environments. It allows developers to integrate My File functionality into their applications using a type-safe and promise-based API client.

### Key Features

- Support for multiple environments: Node.js, Webpack, and Browserify
- Compatibility with both TypeScript and JavaScript projects
- Automatic resolution of TypeScript definitions via `package.json`
- Promise-based API for asynchronous operations
- Comprehensive coverage of My File API endpoints and models

### Getting Started

To use the My File API client in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install the package using npm:

   ```
   npm install @myfile/api-client --save
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules in your code:

   ```typescript
   import { DefaultApi } from "@myfile/api-client";
   ```

3. Create an instance of the API client:

   ```typescript
   const api = new DefaultApi();
   ```

4. Use the API client methods to interact with the My File API. For example:
   ```typescript
   api
     .getUser()
     .then((response) => {
       console.log(response.data);
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error(error);
     });
   ```

### Deployment with AWS

To deploy and run the My File API client with an AWS account, follow these steps:

1. Set up an AWS account if you don't have one already.

2. Configure your AWS credentials locally using the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws configure
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Build the project:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

5. Deploy the client to your desired AWS service (e.g., Lambda, EC2, ECS) based on your application architecture. For example, if you're using AWS Lambda:

   - Create a new Lambda function
   - Package the built files and upload them to the Lambda function
   - Set the appropriate environment variables and permissions

6. Invoke the deployed client from your application code or AWS services as needed.

Note: The specific deployment steps may vary depending on your AWS setup and application requirements.

### Documentation

For detailed information on the available API endpoints, request/response models, and usage examples, refer to the generated TypeScript code and the API specification file (`api.ts`).

The client provides a `DefaultApi` class that serves as the main entry point for making API requests. Each API endpoint is represented by a method in the `DefaultApi` class, accepting the necessary parameters and returning a promise that resolves to the API response.

The `models` directory contains the TypeScript interfaces for the request and response models used by the API client. These interfaces provide type safety and document the structure of the data exchanged with the My File API.
