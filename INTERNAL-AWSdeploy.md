# Deploying to AWS and Configuring CNAME and SSL

This document outlines the steps to deploy your application to AWS and configure CNAME and SSL using AWS CloudFront.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create and manage resources.
- AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) installed and configured on your local machine.
- A registered custom domain name.

## Deploying to AWS

1. Set up your AWS credentials:

   - Run `aws configure` in your terminal.
   - Provide your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format.

2. Create an IAM user for deployment:

   - Go to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) console in AWS.
   - Create a new user with programmatic access.
   - Attach policies that grant the necessary permissions for deployment (e.g., S3, CloudFront, Route 53).
   - Note down the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for the IAM user.

3. Deploy your application:
   - Use AWS deployment tools or services like AWS CodeDeploy, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or AWS CloudFormation.
   - Follow the specific deployment instructions for your chosen deployment method.
   - Ensure that your application code is deployed to the appropriate AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets).

## Configuring CNAME and SSL

1. Request an SSL/TLS certificate:

   - Go to the Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) console in AWS.
   - Request a new SSL/TLS certificate for your custom domain name.
   - ACM will send a validation email to the registered owner of the domain.
   - Follow the instructions in the email to validate the domain ownership.
   - Note down the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the issued certificate.

2. Configure CloudFront distribution:

   - Go to the CloudFront console in AWS.
   - Create a new distribution or edit an existing one.
   - In the distribution settings, associate the SSL/TLS certificate with the distribution.
   - Set the "Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)" field to your custom domain name.
   - Configure other distribution settings as per your requirements.
   - Save the changes.

3. Create a CNAME record:

   - Go to your domain registrar's DNS management console.
   - Create a new CNAME record.
   - Set the name of the CNAME record to your custom domain name (e.g., www.example.com).
   - Set the value of the CNAME record to the domain name of your CloudFront distribution (e.g., abcdefgh12345.cloudfront.net).
   - Save the DNS changes.

4. Wait for DNS propagation:

   - DNS changes can take some time to propagate globally.
   - Wait for a few minutes to a few hours for the changes to take effect.

5. Access your website:
   - Once the DNS propagation is complete, you should be able to access your website using your custom domain name over HTTPS.
   - Example: https://www.example.com

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during the deployment or CNAME and SSL configuration, double-check the AWS console for any error messages or logs.
- Ensure that the IAM user has the necessary permissions to perform the required actions.
- Verify that the SSL/TLS certificate is properly associated with the CloudFront distribution.
- Check that the CNAME record in your domain registrar's DNS management console is correctly configured.
