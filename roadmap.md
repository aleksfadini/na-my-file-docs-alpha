# My File: Future Improvements and Known Limitations

This document outlines the future direction of the My File project and current limitations that need to be addressed.

## Current Limitations

### 1. Resource Naming and Multiple Deployments

- Some resources are hardcoded with 'na' prefix (New America specific)
- While `ORG_NAME_ABBV` helps with customization, certain resources don't use this variable
- Multiple deployments in the same account require manual renaming

### 2. Configuration Management

- Agent emails are hardcoded in `na-my-file-api/src/constants.ts`
- Environment variables scattered across multiple `params.env` files
- No central configuration management system
- Manual updates required for each deployment

### 3. Deployment Process

- Relies on shell scripts for deployment
- Manual steps required for environment setup
- No automated rollback mechanism
- Limited environment parity guarantees

## Future Improvements

### 1. Admin Dashboard

Priority: High

- Centralized configuration management
- Dynamic agent management
- Resource naming configuration
- Environment variable management
- Deployment status monitoring
- Audit logging

### 2. Infrastructure Modernization

Priority: High

- Containerize all components using Docker
- Implement Kubernetes deployment (optional)
- Create Helm charts for deployment
- Implement infrastructure testing

### 3. CI/CD Improvements

Priority: Medium

- Replace shell scripts with GitHub Actions
- Implement automated testing in CI pipeline
- Add deployment validation steps
- Automated rollback procedures
- Environment promotion workflow

### 4. Resource Naming Abstraction

Priority: High

- Create a resource naming service
- Remove hardcoded prefixes
- Implement naming collision detection
- Support multiple deployments in same account

### 5. Configuration Management

Priority: Medium

- Implement central configuration service
- Dynamic environment configuration
- Secrets rotation
- Configuration version control

### 6. Monitoring and Observability

Priority: Low

- Enhanced CloudWatch dashboards
- Distributed tracing
- Performance monitoring
- Cost optimization tracking

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Short Term** (1-2 months):

   - Resource naming abstraction
   - Basic admin dashboard
   - GitHub Actions implementation

2. **Medium Term** (3-6 months):

   - Containerization
   - Configuration management service
   - Enhanced CI/CD pipeline

3. **Long Term** (6+ months):
   - Full admin dashboard
   - Advanced monitoring
   - Multi-region support

## Notes for Future Developers

1. **Resource Naming**

   - Start with abstracting resource names in infrastructure code
   - Create a naming convention service
   - Update deployment scripts to use new naming system

2. **Configuration**

   - Begin with centralizing configuration in a single service
   - Implement API for configuration management
   - Create admin interface for configuration

3. **Deployment**
   - Start with basic GitHub Actions workflow
   - Gradually add more sophisticated deployment features
   - Implement proper testing and validation
